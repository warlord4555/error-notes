# error-notes
telling how i fixed some things

With my memory of a goldfish i often forget the solutions of ubiquitous errors or problems.
And i came up with the idea of keeping them here. 

if you're reading this, then most likely you're struggling
with such irritating issues as errors. keep  going, budd!

may the luck be with you ;)
